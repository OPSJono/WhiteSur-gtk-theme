# WhiteSur GTK Theme
This repo is a fork of [vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme)

### Why?
This fork is so that I can make a couple of very minor tweaks to the theme to suit my preferences.  
Changes:
* The app icon in the Gnome top bar is now full colour.
* The Nord theme will use the standard window titlebar min,max,close buttons.
* The Nord theme will mostly use the standard theme's colour pallete.
  * nord-default is the standard blue.
  * nord-blue is unchanged.
  * All other nord colours are the same as their standard colour.

## Installation
Install with:  
```
./install.sh --nordcolor -c dark
./tweaks.sh --flatpak --snap
```
